# Analisi prestazionale risoluzione matrici e compressione immagini
Part 1
Statistical analysis of sparse matrices resolution in different programming languages:
- R
- Matlab
- Python
On different operating systems:
- Windows
- Linux
Creation of the code for measuring performance on the various languages mentioned above.

Part 2
Statistical analysis compression images on the DCT using the Python programming language.
Creation of source code for the simulation of a DCT and comparison with an already Open Source developed library.
